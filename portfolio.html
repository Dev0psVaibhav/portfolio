                <h3>Project: Created different web-pages</h3>
                <p>Description of project 1: I embarked on a website creation project
                     using HTML and CSS. This endeavor involved designing a visually 
                     appealing and functional website from scratch. By combining HTML
                      for structure and CSS for styling, I gained hands-on experience
                       in web development, honing my skills in coding, design,
                     and user interface development.</p>
